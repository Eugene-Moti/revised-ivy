# TODO for Buy Page Implementation

- [x] Create src/app/buy/page.tsx with hero section (SVG house animation, "BUY YOUR DREAM HOME" text), and sections for each property (Blossom Ivy, Luckinn Ivy, Ivy Park) including descriptions, room type cards (2,3,4 bedrooms, penthouse) with images and inquire buttons.
- [x] Update src/app/Navbar.tsx to change BUY href from "#" to "/buy" in both desktop and mobile menus.
- [ ] Test the Buy page for correct rendering, navigation, and responsiveness.
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub using gh CLI.
