# TODO for LET Page Implementation

- [x] Create src/app/let/page.tsx with coming soon message and minimalist architectural line-draw animation (SVG house icon drawing over 3 seconds, followed by "COMING SOON" fade-in)
- [x] Update src/app/Navbar.tsx to link LET tab to "/let" in both desktop and mobile menus using Next.js Link component
- [x] Run development server and test the /let page for correct animation and navigation
- [x] Add appealing video background (230609_tiny.mp4) to LET page with overlay for text readability (removed due to blending issues)
- [x] Make house icon bigger (increase size to 300x225)
- [x] Make line-draw animation loop infinitely
- [x] Animate "COMING" from left to center and "SOON" from right to center
